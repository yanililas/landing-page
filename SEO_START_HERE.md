## 🛠️ New Commands Available

I've added these to your `package.json`:

```bash
# Generate sitemap (after adding articles)
npm run build:sitemap

# Full build (TinaCMS + articles + sitemap)  
npm run build

# SEO audit reminder (shows testing URLs)
npm run seo:audit

# Development server
npm run dev
```

---

## ✨ What Makes This Special

### 1. Automated Sitemap Generation
Unlike most sites that need manual sitemap updates, yours now updates automatically! Every time you build, the script scans your articles and generates a fresh sitemap.

### 2. Comprehensive Yet Actionable
Most SEO guides are either too vague or too overwhelming. This gives you both the big picture AND specific tasks.

### 3. Tailored to Your Niche
All keyword research and strategies are specifically for **AI + Journalism + Ethics**, not generic SEO.

### 4. Realistic Timelines
No "rank #1 in 30 days" BS. This sets realistic expectations: 3-6 months for solid results.

### 5. Both Quick Wins & Long-term Strategy
You get immediate improvements (Path A) AND a comprehensive plan (Path B).

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Don't Skip Analytics Setup!
Without Google Analytics and Search Console, you're flying blind. These are FREE and essential. Set them up TODAY.

### Be Patient
SEO takes 3-6 months minimum. Don't expect overnight results. Consistent effort wins.

### Content is King
The #1 ranking factor is helpful, original content. Focus 60% of your effort here.

### Mobile Matters
60%+ of your traffic will be mobile. Always test on phone.

### Speed Wins  
Google uses page speed as a ranking factor. Keep pages under 3 seconds.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Do Path A first, then expand to Path B
2. **Track Everything**: Data beats guesswork every time
3. **Be Consistent**: 3 hours/week > 20 hours/month
4. **User First**: Write for humans, optimize for search engines
5. **Stay Curious**: SEO changes constantly, keep learning
6. **Build Relationships**: Link building is relationship building
7. **Quality > Quantity**: For both content and backlinks
