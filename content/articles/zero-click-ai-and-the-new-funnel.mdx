# Zero‑click AI and the new funnel

As AI answers questions directly, publishers must rethink how they attract, engage, and monetize audiences.

## The Zero-Click Problem

Search engines have been moving toward zero-click results for years—providing answers directly on the search results page without requiring users to visit websites. Now, with AI-powered search and chatbots, this trend has accelerated dramatically.

**Zero-click AI** refers to AI systems that answer user queries without sending traffic to the original content sources. Users get their answers instantly, but publishers lose:

- Website traffic
- Ad revenue
- Brand visibility
- Direct audience relationships

## The Traditional Funnel is Broken

The classic publisher funnel looked like this:

1. **Discovery**: Users find content through search or social media
2. **Click**: Users visit the publisher's website
3. **Engagement**: Users read articles, view ads
4. **Conversion**: Users subscribe, purchase, or return

With zero-click AI, steps 2-4 are bypassed entirely. The content is consumed, but the publisher receives no direct benefit.

## The New Reality for Publishers

Publishers now face three possible futures:

### 1. Content as a Loss Leader

Accept that content will be freely consumed by AI systems, and focus on monetizing other aspects:

- Premium memberships for AI-free experiences
- Direct community engagement
- Exclusive events and products
- Consulting and services

### 2. AI-First Distribution

Optimize content specifically for AI consumption:

- Structure content for easy extraction
- Partner with AI platforms for attribution and compensation
- Focus on being the "source of truth" that AI cites

### 3. Walled Gardens

Restrict AI access and require direct engagement:

- Paywalls that AI cannot bypass
- Proprietary platforms
- Member-only content
- Interactive experiences AI cannot replicate

## Strategies for Adaptation

### Build Direct Relationships

Focus on email lists, newsletters, and communities where you own the audience relationship. AI may summarize your content, but it can't replicate a personal connection.

### Create AI-Resistant Content

Develop content that's difficult for AI to replicate:

- Original reporting and investigations
- Personality-driven commentary
- Interactive tools and experiences
- Real-time coverage and analysis

### Demand Fair Compensation

Publishers should advocate for systems where AI platforms:

- Pay for training data
- Provide clear attribution
- Share revenue when content is used
- Respect opt-out preferences

### Embrace Hybrid Models

The future likely involves a mix of approaches:

- Free content for AI consumption (building brand awareness)
- Premium content behind paywalls
- Community features that add value beyond information
- Services and products that monetize expertise

## The Opportunity in Crisis

While zero-click AI poses challenges, it also creates opportunities:

**AI as a discovery tool**: Users may find your brand through AI and seek deeper engagement

**Quality over quantity**: Publishers can focus on fewer, higher-quality pieces instead of chasing traffic volume

**New value propositions**: Shift from being information providers to being curators, analysts, and community builders

## What Averris Does

Averris helps publishers navigate this transition by:

- **Protecting attribution**: Ensuring your content is properly credited when used by AI
- **Optimizing for discoverability**: Making your content findable and citable
- **Building audience trust**: Helping readers understand your unique value beyond raw information

## Conclusion

The zero-click AI era requires publishers to fundamentally rethink their value proposition. Success won't come from fighting AI, but from understanding how to coexist with it—building direct relationships, creating irreplaceable content, and demanding fair compensation for the value you provide.

**The funnel has changed. The question is: how will you adapt?**
